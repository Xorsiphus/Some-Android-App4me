Deployment:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory(./SomeUtilsApp), you can run:

### `npm install`

### `expo start` (`npm start`)

When you run expo start (npm start), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.
